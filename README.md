# qls — QR Link Server

Generate a QR code that opens your local dev server from another device on your LAN.

## Install

### Global (preferred for quick usage):

`npm i -g qls` then `qls 3000`

### No install (one‑off use):

`npx qls 3000`

### Local dev (from this repo):

`npm link` then `qls 3000`

## Usage

```
qls <port>

Example: qls 3000
```

qls waits until the given port is reachable on localhost, rewrites the host to your LAN IP, prints a QR in the terminal, and echoes the URL.

## Why

Open your local dev server on a phone/tablet without typing IPs. Great for testing responsive layouts, PWAs, and camera features.

## Notes

Requires Node.js (LTS recommended). Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

The QR encodes `http://<your-lan-ip>:<port>` - ensure your device is on the same Wi‑Fi/LAN and your firewall allows access.

## Troubleshooting

Can’t find LAN IP: some environments (e.g., containers) may restrict network interfaces. Run on your host OS or expose interfaces.

Port never becomes ready: ensure your dev server is running on the given port and listening on localhost.

## Alternatives / Name ideas

Other nice names we considered (wanted something short and memorable): `qres`, `lan-qr`, `dev-qr`, `qr-dev-link`, `qrserve`, `qr-open`, `port2qr`
